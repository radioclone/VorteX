# VorteX: Token-Gated Cultural Experiences on Soneium

A token-gated Web3 dApp for the Soneium Hackathon that uses AI agent dialogue, audio immersion, and on-chain mechanics for access gating.

## üé≠ Vision & Problem Statement

VorteX addresses a critical challenge for cultural event creators: how to monetize digital experiences while maintaining creative control and building direct relationships with audiences.

Inspired by the Vortex techno event series, this project creates a framework for token-gated cultural experiences that leverage Soneium's sonic asset capabilities to create new monetization models for creators.

## üèÜ Why VorteX Matters for Soneium

Soneium's focus on sonic assets and cultural experiences makes it the ideal platform for VorteX:

1. **Cultural Experience Monetization**: VorteX demonstrates how Soneium can power new business models for event creators
2. **Sonic Asset Utilization**: The project leverages Soneium's unique capabilities for audio-based NFTs and experiences
3. **Community Building**: TEE DOGG agent creates engaging interactions that build community around cultural experiences
4. **Gamified Engagement**: The dice roll mechanic shows how randomness can create compelling user journeys on Soneium

## üöÄ Progress for Hackathon Judges

## üé≤ Startale Integration

The project includes a structured integration with Startale:

1. **Configuration**: `startale-integration/startale-config.js` contains placeholders for RPC URL and contract address
2. **Mock Implementation**: `startale-integration/startale-dice-roller.js` provides a mock implementation with toggle for real integration
3. **Integration Points**: Clear interfaces for connecting to the real Startale RPC

To activate real Startale integration:
1. Update the RPC URL and contract address in `startale-config.js`
2. Set the `useStartale` parameter to `true` when calling `rollDiceOnChain`

## üîó Sequence Integration

The project includes a structured integration with Sequence:

1. **Wallet Connection**: `sequence-bridge/index.js` provides wallet connection functionality
2. **State Management**: `sequence-bridge/state.js` implements a singleton state manager
3. **NFT Verification**: `sequence-bridge/marketplace.js` contains mock NFT verification logic

To activate real Sequence integration:
1. Uncomment the Sequence SDK imports in `sequence-bridge/index.js`
2. Replace mock implementations with real SDK calls

## üîÆ Future Development

With additional resources, VorteX will expand to include:

### üß∞ üì¶ Future Architecture Considerations (Post-Hackathon)

While this submission is optimized for rapid development and modular experimentation, the following architecture extensions are under consideration:

#### üê≥ Containerization Plan
- Future modules (e.g., **voice synthesis**, **NFT verification APIs**, or **Supabase-backed logic**) can be packaged into **independent Docker containers**
- This allows clean separation of logic, creative tooling, and real-time backends across services

#### üîß Frontend Scalability
- Current structure uses **vanilla HTML + HTMX + JS** to minimize friction and optimize creative flexibility
- A future **Vite-based Remix/Next.js UI layer** may be introduced to support:
  - Authenticated dashboards
  - Marketplace integrations
  - Wallet session management
- This will remain isolated from the creative layer to avoid introducing architectural bottlenecks prematurely

#### üéÆ Dynamic Scene Embedding
- The interface layer is built to support **interactive visual frameworks**, such as:
  - **Unity3D**
  - **Godot**
  - **Interactive Interface Module**
  - or any future custom renderer
- These will communicate with the main app using postMessage or local socket bridge and can be containerized independently
