## Documentation Purpose

This documentation serves multiple purposes:

1. **Project Understanding**: Provides a comprehensive overview of the VorteX project
2. **Development Guide**: Outlines the technical approach and implementation plans
3. **Status Transparency**: Clearly communicates the current state of development
4. **Vision Communication**: Articulates the long-term vision and goals
5. **Hackathon Submission**: Supports the Soneium Hackathon submission

## Documentation Diagrams

The documentation includes various diagrams to visualize different aspects of the project:

- **Architecture Diagrams**: Component relationships and data flows
- **User Journey Maps**: User experience and interaction paths
- **Development Timelines**: Project roadmap and milestones
- **Technology Evolution**: Progression of technical implementations
- **Feedback Processes**: Structured approach to gathering and implementing feedback

## Current Project Status

The VorteX project is currently in the early stages of development. The documentation reflects both the current state and the planned future state of the project. For a detailed assessment of the current implementation status, see the [Current Status](CURRENT-STATUS.md) document.
