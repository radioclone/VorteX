# VorteX Technical Vision

This document outlines the long-term technical vision for the VorteX project, including architectural goals, scaling considerations, and future technology integration plans.

## Core Technical Philosophy

The VorteX project is built on several key technical principles:

1. **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with well-defined interfaces
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Core functionality works without advanced features, enhanced when available
3. **Minimal JavaScript Footprint**: Using HTMX and targeted JS rather than heavy frameworks
4. **Immersive Experience**: Prioritizing audio and interaction quality for engagement
5. **Blockchain Integration**: Thoughtful integration of Web3 technologies without compromising UX
